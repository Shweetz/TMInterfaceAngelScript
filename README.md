# TMInterfaceAngelScript
My AngelScript plugins for TMInterface

To use my plugin, download the folder "Shweetz" and place it in TMI's Plugins so the path is: Documents\TMInterface\Plugins\Shweetz


AS plugins in TMI are recognized when they are dragged as folders (containing several AS files) or singles files in Documents\TMInterface\Plugins.

You should usually not separate files that are in a plugin folder as they are meant to work together.

For example, Documents\TMInterface\Plugins\Shweetz should contain several AS files.
